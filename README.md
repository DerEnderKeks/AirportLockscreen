# AirportLockscreen
This is an Android app that allows to disable lockscreen features. I originally made it for use at airports to make your phone a little bit more secure.

## Installation
To use this app download this project, open it with Android Studio, build it and then copy the APK to your phone. 

I may or may not add this app the Google Play Store at some point.

## Usage
Use the switches to enable or disable specific lockscreen features. Those switches only take effect when the the main switch is active. If the main switch is disabled all features are enabled.
